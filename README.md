### Input

- any key - start a new game after win/draw is reached

The game obeys the usual chess rules. The pieces in the picture are in their initial positions at the start of the game. There's a little highlight on the field of the board which is currently selected, which you can use arrow keys to move around. You can use it to select a piece to play with, and then the field you want to play it to. If you want to deselect a piece, simply click enter on the same field you selected it on.

White and black play in turns, and there is no AI, it's a two player game.

Details of the implementation can be found within the comments in the code and Wiki logs.
